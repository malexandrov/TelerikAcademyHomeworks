1. Write a program that fills and prints a matrix of size (n, n) as shown below: (examples for n = 4)

2. Write a program that reads a rectangular matrix of size N x M and finds in it the square 3 x 3 that has maximal sum of its elements.

3. We are given a matrix of strings of size N x M. Sequences in the matrix we define as sets of several neighbor elements located on the same line, column or diagonal. Write a program that finds the longest sequence of equal strings in the matrix. 

4. Write a program, that reads from the console an array of N integers and an integer K, sorts the array and using the method Array.BinSearch() finds the largest number in the array which is ? K. 

5. You are given an array of strings. Write a method that sorts the array by the length of its elements (the number of characters composing them).

6.* Write a class Matrix, to holds a matrix of integers. Overload the operators for adding, subtracting and multiplying of matrices, indexer for accessing the matrix content and ToString().

7.* Write a program that finds the largest area of equal neighbor elements in a rectangular matrix and prints its size. Example:
