1.Describe the strings in C#. What is typical for the string data type? Describe the most important methods of the String class.

2.Write a program that reads a string, reverses it and prints the result at the console.
Example: "sample" ? "elpmas".

3.Write a program to check if in a given expression the brackets are put correctly.
Example of correct expression: ((a+b)/5-d).
Example of incorrect expression: )(a+b)).

4.Write a program that finds how many times a substring is contained in a given text (perform case insensitive search).

5.You are given a text. Write a program that changes the text in all regions surrounded by the tags <upcase> and </upcase> to uppercase. The tags cannot be nested. 

6.Write a program that reads from the console a string of maximum 20 characters. If the length of the string is less than 20, the rest of the characters should be filled with '*'. Print the result string into the console.

7.Write a program that encodes and decodes a string using given encryption key (cipher). The key consists of a sequence of characters. The encoding/decoding is done by performing XOR (exclusive or) operation over the first letter of the string with the first of the key, the second – with the second, etc. When the last key character is reached, the next is the first.

8.Write a program that extracts from a given text all sentences containing given word.

9.We are given a string containing a list of forbidden words and a text containing some of these words. Write a program that replaces the forbidden words with asterisks. 

10.Write a program that converts a string to a sequence of C# Unicode character literals. Use format strings. Sample input:

11.Write a program that reads a number and prints it as a decimal number, hexadecimal number, percentage and in scientific notation. Format the output aligned right in 15 symbols.

12.Write a program that parses an URL address given in the format:

		and extracts from it the [protocol], [server] and [resource] elements. 

13.Write a program that reverses the words in given sentence.
	Example: "C# is not C++, not PHP and not Delphi!" ? "Delphi not and PHP, not C++ not is C#!".

14.A dictionary is stored as a sequence of text lines containing words and their explanations. Write a program that enters a word and translates it by using the dictionary. 

15.Write a program that replaces in a HTML document given as string all the tags <a href="…">…</a> with corresponding tags [URL=…]…/URL]. Sample HTML fragment:

16.Write a program that reads two dates in the format: day.month.year and calculates the number of days between them. Example:

17.Write a program that reads a date and time given in the format: day.month.year hour:minute:second and prints the date and time after 6 hours and 30 minutes (in the same format) along with the day of week in Bulgarian.

18.Write a program for extracting all email addresses from given text. All substrings that match the format <identifier>@<host>…<domain> should be recognized as emails.

19.Write a program that extracts from a given text all dates that match the format DD.MM.YYYY. Display them in the standard date format for Canada.

20.Write a program that extracts from a given text all palindromes, e.g. "ABBA", "lamal", "exe".

21.Write a program that reads a string from the console and prints all different letters in the string along with information how many times each letter is found. 

22.Write a program that reads a string from the console and lists all different words in the string along with information how many times each word is found.

23.Write a program that reads a string from the console and replaces all series of consecutive identical letters with a single one. Example: "aaaaabbbbbcdddeeeedssaa" ? "abcdedsa".

24.Write a program that reads a list of words, separated by spaces and prints the list in an alphabetical order.

25.Write a program that extracts from given HTML file its title (if available), and its body text without the HTML tags.
